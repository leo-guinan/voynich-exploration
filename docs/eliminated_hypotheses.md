# Eliminated Hypotheses

This document tracks hypotheses that have been **disproven** or **strongly disfavored** by evidence.

**Critical principle**: Every time you disprove something, write it down. This alone puts you ahead of 90% of Voynich work.

## Format

For each eliminated hypothesis:
- **Hypothesis**: What was tested
- **Evidence**: What data/analysis disproved it
- **Date**: When it was eliminated
- **Confidence**: High / Medium / Low

---

## Example Entry

### Hypothesis: Voynich is simple substitution cipher
- **Evidence**: Compression ratio similar to natural language, not cipher
- **Date**: [Date]
- **Confidence**: High
- **Notes**: gzip compression of Voynich text is ~2.5:1, similar to Latin texts, not typical of substitution ciphers which compress ~1.5:1

*Add entries as hypotheses are tested and eliminated.*
