# Working Assumptions

This document tracks all assumptions made during research. Assumptions should be:
- Explicitly stated
- Testable
- Revisable

## Image Assumptions

- [ ] All folio images are extracted losslessly from the PDF
- [ ] Folio naming convention (f001r, f001v) matches manuscript structure
- [ ] No pages are missing or duplicated

## Text Assumptions

- [ ] EVA transcriptions are accurate representations of glyph sequences
- [ ] Line breaks in transcriptions correspond to visual line breaks
- [ ] Word boundaries are correctly identified

## Structural Assumptions

- [ ] Sections (botanical, astronomical, etc.) are meaningful divisions
- [ ] Currier languages A and B represent distinct systems
- [ ] Folio order is preserved

## Statistical Assumptions

- [ ] Zipf-like distributions indicate language-like structure
- [ ] Compression ratios can distinguish language from cipher from noise
- [ ] Position effects (line start, word start) are meaningful

## Research Assumptions

- [ ] The manuscript represents a single coherent system
- [ ] The system is either: language, cipher, hoax, or other
- [ ] Classification is possible without full decryption

*Add assumptions as they arise. Mark as verified or disproven.*
